<li><strong>Improved Indoor Air Quality:</strong><br /><p>Natural wood furniture can help to improve indoor air quality by absorbing and releasing moisture from the air. This helps to regulate humidity levels and reduce the risk of respiratory problems and other health issues associated with poor air quality.</p></li>
