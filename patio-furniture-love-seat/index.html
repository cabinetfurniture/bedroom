<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Garden furniture plays a vital role in creating an inviting and comfortable outdoor space. When choosing garden furniture, consider factors such as durability, comfort, style, and weather resistance. Opt for high-quality materials like teak, aluminum, or synthetic wicker that can withstand the elements and last for many years.</p>
<p>Regular maintenance is essential to keep your garden furniture looking its best and prolong its lifespan. Clean your furniture regularly with a mild soap and water solution, and use a sealant or protective finish to protect it from moisture and UV damage. Store your furniture properly during the off-season to protect it from harsh weather conditions.</p>
