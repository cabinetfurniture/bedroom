<h3>Simple, handcrafted forms</h3>
<p>One of the defining characteristics of Arts and Crafts period furniture is its simple, handcrafted forms. This reflects the movement's emphasis on functionality and a rejection of the overly ornate and mass-produced furniture of the Victorian era.</p>
<p>Arts and Crafts furniture makers often drew inspiration from traditional folk art and vernacular furniture forms. They believed that these simple forms were more honest and authentic than the elaborate designs of the Victorian era. They also believed that simple forms were more functional and practical for everyday use.</p>
<p>As a result, Arts and Crafts furniture is often characterized by clean lines, geometric shapes, and minimal ornamentation. This simplicity of form allowed the beauty of the natural materials used in construction to shine through.</p>
<p>Arts and Crafts furniture makers also paid great attention to craftsmanship. They used traditional hand-crafting techniques to create furniture that was both beautiful and durable. This attention to detail is evident in the fine joinery, carved details, and hand-hammered hardware that are often found on Arts and Crafts furniture.</p>
<p>The simple, handcrafted forms of Arts and Crafts furniture are a reflection of the movement's emphasis on functionality, honesty, and beauty. This furniture is designed to be both useful and beautiful, and it is made to last for generations.</p>
<h3>Natural materials</h3>
<p>Arts and Crafts furniture makers believed that natural materials were essential for creating beautiful and durable furniture. They favored woods with natural grain patterns, such as oak, maple, and cherry. They also used other natural materials, such as leather, copper, and stone.</p>
<p>Arts and Crafts furniture makers often left the natural finish of the wood exposed, or they used simple stains and finishes to enhance the wood's natural beauty. This allowed the grain and texture of the wood to shine through.</p>
<p>The use of natural materials in Arts and Crafts furniture is a reflection of the movement's emphasis on honesty and simplicity. Arts and Crafts furniture makers believed that natural materials were more honest and authentic than artificial materials. They also believed that natural materials were more beautiful and durable.</p>
<p>The use of natural materials also helped to create a sense of unity between the furniture and the natural world. Arts and Crafts furniture is often designed to blend in with its surroundings, rather than standing out as a separate object.</p>
<p>The use of natural materials is one of the things that makes Arts and Crafts furniture so appealing. Natural materials are warm and inviting, and they create a sense of connection to the natural world. Arts and Crafts furniture is also very durable, as natural materials are strong and long-lasting.</p>
