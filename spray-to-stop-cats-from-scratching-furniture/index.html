<p>By choosing a spray deterrent that is long-lasting, you can save yourself time and money in the long run. You won't have to worry about reapplying the deterrent frequently, and you can rest assured that your furniture is protected from scratching.</p>
<h3>Available in a variety of scents</h3>
<p>Cats have a strong sense of smell, and they are repelled by certain scents. This is why many spray deterrents contain ingredients that have a strong, unpleasant odor to cats. However, not all cats are repelled by the same scents, so it is important to choose a spray deterrent that contains a scent that your cat finds particularly unpleasant.</p>
<p>There are a number of spray deterrents on the market that are available in a variety of scents. This allows you to choose a scent that is most effective for your cat. Some of the most common scents used in spray deterrents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Citrus: Citrus scents are a popular choice for spray deterrents because they are very unpleasant to cats. Lemons, oranges, and grapefruits are all good choices.</li>
<li>Vinegar: Vinegar is another strong scent that cats find unpleasant. It is also a natural disinfectant, so it can help to keep your furniture clean.</li>
<li>Peppermint: Peppermint is a minty scent that can be very effective at deterring cats. It is also a natural insect repellent, so it can help to keep your furniture free of pests.</li>
<li>Lavender: Lavender is a calming scent that is often used in aromatherapy. However, it can also be effective at deterring cats. Some cats find the smell of lavender to be overwhelming.</li>
</ul>
<p>When choosing a spray deterrent, it is important to test it on your cat before using it on your furniture. Simply spray a small amount of the deterrent on a piece of cardboard and place it near your cat. Observe your cat's reaction to the scent. If your cat seems to be repelled by the scent, then it is likely to be an effective deterrent.</p><h3>Can be used on multiple Ð²ÑÐ»Ð¸</h3>
