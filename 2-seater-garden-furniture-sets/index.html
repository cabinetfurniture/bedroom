<h3>Comfortable seating</h3>
 Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð´Ð°ÑÐ¾ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ ÑÐ²ÑÐ·ÑThe most important factor to consider when choosing a 6-seater garden furniture set is the comfort of the seating. You want to choose a set that is comfortable to sit in for long periods of time, especially if you plan on using it for entertaining.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cushions:</strong> The cushions on your garden furniture should be made from a high-quality, durable material that is resistant to fading and mildew. They should also be thick enough to provide adequate support and comfort.

  <br /><br />
