Consider factors like durability, weather resistance, and maintenance requirements when making your selection.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 2: How can I choose comfortable garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 2: Comfort is key when it comes to garden furniture. Look for pieces with cushions made of high-quality, weather-resistant fabrics.
