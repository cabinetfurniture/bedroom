Don't be afraid to mix and match different styles and materials. Combining traditional and modern pieces, or using contrasting colors and textures, can add visual interest and create a unique look.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Add Comfort and Style:</strong><br />
Enhance the comfort and style of your garden furniture with cushions, throws, and outdoor rugs. Choose weather-resistant fabrics and materials that can withstand outdoor conditions.
