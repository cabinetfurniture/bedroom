Invest in good-quality brushes or rollers specifically designed for outdoor paint application. This will help you achieve a smooth, even finish without streaks or brush marks.</p>

Be patient and allow each coat of paint to dry thoroughly before applying the next. Rushing the process can result in a compromised finish and may require additional coats.</p>

Once your furniture is painted, protect it from the elements with a clear sealant or varnish. This will help extend the life of the paint finish and keep your furniture looking its best.</p>
