<p><strong><em>Question 5: How can I care for my garden furniture to extend its lifespan?</em></strong><br />
Answer 5: Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential for prolonging the life of your garden furniture. Clean it with a mild detergent and water, and dry it thoroughly. Apply protective sealants or oils to wooden furniture to protect it from moisture and UV damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 6: Where can I find a wide selection of garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 6: Consider visiting reputable furniture stores or online retailers that specialize in garden furniture. You can also explore local garden centers or home improvement stores for a variety of options.</p>
