<p><strong>Tip 2: Reposition the transfer if needed.</strong> Rub-on transfers are repositionable, so if you make a mistake or want to adjust the placement, simply lift the transfer and try again. This flexibility allows you to achieve precise and satisfactory results.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Protect the transfers with a sealant.</strong> Once you're happy with the placement of the transfers, apply a clear sealant or varnish to protect them from wear and tear. This is especially important for outdoor furniture that will be exposed to sun, rain, and other elements.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Experiment with different techniques.</strong> Rub-on transfers offer endless possibilities for creativity. Experiment with layering transfers, combining different designs, or adding hand-painted elements to create unique and personalized designs that reflect your style.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you can ensure that your rub-on transfer projects turn out beautifully and add a touch of charm and personality to your garden furniture.</p>
