<p><strong>Tip 3: Add Functional Accessories:</strong></p>
<p>Accessorize your garden furniture with functional items that enhance your outdoor experience. Outdoor lighting, such as solar-powered lanterns or string lights, can create a magical ambiance in the evening. Consider adding side tables for easy access to drinks and snacks, and storage baskets or boxes to keep cushions and throws organized.</p>
