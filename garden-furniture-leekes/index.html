<h3>Style: Choose furniture that matches the style of your home and garden.</h3>
<p>The style of your garden furniture should complement the style of your home and garden. If you have a traditional home, you may want to choose furniture with classic lines and a timeless design. If you have a more modern home, you may prefer furniture with clean lines and a contemporary look.</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Bohemian:</strong> Bohemian garden furniture is typically made from a mix of materials and features eclectic designs. This type of furniture is perfect for creating a unique and個性ful look in your garden.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have considered the style of your home and garden, you can start to narrow down your choices for garden furniture. Leekes has a wide range of furniture styles to choose from, so you're sure to find the perfect pieces to create your dream outdoor space.</p>
<h3>Material: Consider the climate in your area and choose furniture made from a durable material.</h3>
<p>The climate in your area will play a big role in determining the type of material you choose for your garden furniture. If you live in a climate with extreme temperatures, you'll need to choose furniture that is resistant to fading, cracking, and warping. If you live in a climate with high humidity, you'll need to choose furniture that is resistant to rust and mildew.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most popular materials used for garden furniture, along with their pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wood:</strong> Wood is a classic choice for garden furniture, and it comes in a variety of types, including teak, cedar, and redwood. Wood is durable and can last for many years if it is properly cared for. However, wood is also susceptible to rot and mildew, so it is important to choose a wood that is resistant to these problems.</li>
<li><strong>Metal:</strong> Metal is another popular choice for garden furniture, and it is available in a variety of finishes, including powder-coated, galvanized, and stainless steel. Metal is durable and weather-resistant, but it can be heavy and expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Plastic:</strong> Plastic is a good choice for garden furniture if you are on a budget. Plastic is lightweight and easy to care for, but it can be less durable than wood or metal. Some types of plastic can also fade in the sun.</li>
<li><strong>Wicker:</strong> Wicker is a natural material that is made from the stems of rattan or willow plants. Wicker is lightweight and durable, but it can be susceptible to mildew if it is not properly cared for.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have considered the climate in your area and the different materials available, you can start to narrow down your choices for garden furniture. Leekes has a wide range of furniture materials to choose from, so you're sure to find the perfect pieces to create your dream outdoor space.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cushions:</strong> Cushions can make a big difference in the comfort of your garden furniture. Look for cushions that are made from a durable fabric and that are filled with a comfortable material, such as foam or feathers.</li>
<li><strong>Back support:</strong> If you plan on spending a lot of time sitting in your garden furniture, make sure that it has good back support. Look for furniture with high backs and lumbar support.</li>
<li><strong>Armrests:</strong> Armrests can also add to the comfort of your garden furniture. Look for furniture with armrests that are the right height and width for you.</li>
<li><strong>Size:</strong> Make sure that the furniture is the right size for you and your family. You should be able to sit comfortably in the furniture without feeling cramped.</li>
