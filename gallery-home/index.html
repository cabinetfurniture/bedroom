<p><strong><em>Question 1: How do I choose the right garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 1: Consider factors like the size and layout of your outdoor space, the materials and styles you prefer, and the intended use of the furniture. Choose pieces that are durable, comfortable, and complement your garden's overall design.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 2: What are the different types of garden furniture materials?</em></strong><br />
Answer 2: Common materials include wood (teak, acacia, eucalyptus), metal (wrought iron, aluminum, stainless steel), plastic (polyethylene, polypropylene), and wicker (natural or synthetic). Each material has unique properties in terms of durability, weather resistance, and maintenance requirements.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 3: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 3: Regular cleaning and maintenance will extend the life of your garden furniture. Clean it periodically with mild soap and water, and use specialized cleaners for specific materials like teak or wrought iron.

<p><strong><em>Question 4: How can I make my garden furniture more comfortable?</em></strong><br />

<p><strong><em>Question 5: How do I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
Answer 5: Choose furniture made from weather-resistant materials, or use covers or tarps to protect your furniture from rain, snow, and excessive sun exposure. Store cushions and other fabric items indoors when not in use to prevent fading and water damage.</p>
