</p><ul>
<li><strong>Dresser with a removable changing table:</strong> This type of dresser can be used as a regular dresser once your child is potty trained.</li>

<li><strong>Storage ottoman:</strong> This type of ottoman can be used to store toys, blankets, or other nursery items. It can also be used as a coffee table or a place for your child to sit.</li>
</ul>
<p>By choosing convertible nursery furniture, you can save money in the long run and ensure that your child's furniture grows with them.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you can create a beautiful, functional, and affordable nursery for your little one.</p>
<h3>Non-toxic finishes and paints</h3>
<p>When choosing nursery furniture, it's important to make sure that the finishes and paints are non-toxic. This is especially important for pieces that your child will be chewing on or sucking on, such as cribs, changing tables, and toys.</p>
<p>Look for nursery furniture that has been finished with non-toxic paints and finishes that are free of lead and other harmful chemicals. You can also find nursery furniture that has been Greenguard certified. Greenguard certification means that the furniture has been tested and found to meet strict standards for low chemical emissions.</p>
<p>By choosing nursery furniture with non-toxic finishes and paints, you can help to protect your child's health and well-being.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for choosing nursery furniture with non-toxic finishes and paints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for furniture that is made from solid wood or other natural materials.</li>
<li>Avoid furniture that is made from particle board or MDF (medium-density fiberboard), as these materials can contain harmful chemicals.</li>
<li>Choose furniture that has been finished with water-based paints or finishes.</li>
<li>Avoid furniture that has been finished with oil-based paints or finishes, as these can emit harmful fumes.</li>
<li>Look for furniture that has been Greenguard certified.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Coordinates with other nursery décor</h3>
<p>When choosing nursery furniture, it's important to consider how it will coordinate with the other décor in the room. You want to create a cohesive and stylish space that is both functional and inviting.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a color scheme:</strong> Before you start shopping for furniture, choose a color scheme for the nursery. This will help you narrow down your choices and create a cohesive look.</li>
<li><strong>Consider the style of the room:</strong> The style of the nursery furniture should complement the overall style of the room. For example, if you have a traditional nursery, you'll want to choose furniture with classic lines and finishes. If you have a modern nursery, you'll want to choose furniture with clean lines and simple designs.</li>
<li><strong>Mix and match:</strong> You don't have to buy all of your nursery furniture from the same set. You can mix and match different pieces to create a unique and personalized look. Just make sure that the pieces you choose coordinate with each other in terms of color, style, and finish.</li>
<li><strong>Add personal touches:</strong> Once you've chosen your furniture, you can add personal touches to the nursery with things like wall decals, framed photos, and colorful curtains. This will help to make the space feel more like your own.</li>
</ul>
