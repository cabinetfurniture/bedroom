Invest in comfortable cushions and throws to enhance the comfort of your garden furniture. Choose outdoor fabrics that resist fading and moisture. Incorporate stylish accessories like outdoor rugs, lanterns, and potted plants to add personality and ambiance to your garden.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Maintain Your Furniture Regularly:</strong>
Regular maintenance is essential to prolong the life of your garden furniture. Clean and inspect your furniture periodically, removing dirt, debris, and bird droppings. Apply protective coatings or sealants to wooden furniture to protect it from harsh weather conditions. Store cushions and other accessories indoors when not in use.</p>
