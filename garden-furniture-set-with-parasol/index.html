<p><strong>2. Fabric and Cushions:</strong> Choose fabrics that are UV-resistant and water-repellent to prevent fading and damage from sunlight and rain. Opt for quick-drying materials like Sunbrella or Olefin for cushions, as they are easy to clean and maintain.</p>
<p><strong>3. Parasol Canopy:</strong> The parasol canopy is exposed to constant sun and rain, so select a durable fabric such as acrylic or polyester. These fabrics offer excellent UV protection, are water-repellent, and resist fading.</p>
