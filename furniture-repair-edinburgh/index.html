<h3>French Polishing</h3>
<p>French polishing is a specialized technique used to create a smooth, glossy finish on wooden furniture. At Furniture Repair Edinburgh, our artisans are masters of this traditional craft, meticulously applying multiple layers of shellac to achieve a stunning and durable finish.</p>
<p>The French polishing process begins with careful preparation of the wood surface. Our artisans sand and smooth the wood to remove any imperfections, ensuring a flawless base for the shellac. They then apply several thin coats of shellac, using a pad soaked in alcohol and oil. Each coat is allowed to dry completely before the next is applied, and the process is repeated until the desired level of depth and shine is achieved.</p>
<p>French polishing not only enhances the beauty of wooden furniture but also protects it from moisture and wear. The shellac finish creates a hard, durable barrier that resists scratches and stains, ensuring your furniture remains in pristine condition for years to come.</p>
<p>Whether you have an antique piece in need of restoration or a modern piece that you want to elevate to the next level, our French polishing service can transform your furniture into a true work of art. Trust our skilled artisans to bring out the natural beauty and elegance of your wooden possessions.</p>
<p>With our French polishing expertise, we breathe new life into your cherished furniture, allowing you to appreciate its beauty and functionality for generations to come.</p>
<h3>Wood Refinishing</h3>
<p>Wood refinishing is an art form that involves restoring the natural beauty and luster of wooden furniture. At Furniture Repair Edinburgh, our skilled artisans employ various techniques to refinish wood, bringing new life to tired and worn-out pieces.</p>
<p>The wood refinishing process typically begins with stripping away the old finish, using specialized chemicals or sanding techniques. Once the wood is stripped down to its bare surface, our artisans assess its condition and identify any areas that require repair or restoration.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of wood and the desired finish, our artisans may apply stains, dyes, or paints to enhance the wood's natural grain and color. They may also use techniques such as distressing or antiquing to create a unique and aged look.</p>
<p>The final step in the wood refinishing process is the application of a protective finish. This can be a lacquer, varnish, or oil, depending on the desired level of sheen and durability. The finish protects the wood from moisture, wear, and UV damage, ensuring it remains beautiful for years to come.</p>
<p>With our wood refinishing expertise, we can transform your old and worn-out furniture into stunning pieces that look like new. Whether you have an antique table that needs restoration or a modern piece that you want to update, our artisans can help you achieve the perfect finish.</p>

At Furniture Repair Edinburgh, our skilled artisans are experts in both caning and rushwork, meticulously repairing and restoring damaged or worn-out pieces.</p>
<p>Caning involves weaving thin strands of rattan or cane onto a furniture frame, creating a durable and flexible seat or backrest. Our artisans use traditional tools and techniques to ensure that the cane is properly tensioned and secured, providing both comfort and support.</p>
<p>Rushwork, on the other hand, utilizes dried rush plant fibers to create a natural and rustic look. Our artisans carefully select and prepare the rush fibers before weaving them into intricate patterns on chair seats, headboards, and other furniture pieces.
