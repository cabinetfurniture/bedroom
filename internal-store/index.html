<p>The internal store of a computer system plays a crucial role in managing and storing data. It encompasses both volatile and non-volatile memory, each with distinct characteristics and applications.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volatile Memory:</strong><br />
<p>Volatile memory, also known as temporary memory, is the workhorse of the internal store. It holds data that is currently being processed by the central processing unit (CPU) or is awaiting processing. Volatile memory is typically implemented using dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips, which require constant electrical power to retain data. When the power supply is interrupted, the data stored in volatile memory is lost. This type of memory is commonly used for storing program instructions, intermediate results of calculations, and data that needs to be accessed frequently.</p></li>
<li><strong>Non-Volatile Memory:</strong><br />
<p>Non-volatile memory, in contrast to volatile memory, retains data even when the power supply is turned off. It is commonly implemented using flash memory chips, which employ a special type of transistor to store data without the need for constant power. Non-volatile memory is used to store permanent data and program instructions, such as the operating system, application software, and user files. Examples of non-volatile memory include solid-state drives (SSDs), USB flash drives, and memory cards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of volatile and non-volatile memory in the internal store provides a versatile and efficient data storage solution for computers, enabling the storage of both temporary and permanent data.</p>
<h3>Directly accessible by CPU</h3>
<p>One of the key advantages of the internal store is its direct accessibility by the central processing unit (CPU). This means that the CPU can read data from and write data to the internal store without the need for any intermediate devices or controllers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong><br />
<p>Direct access to the internal store enables incredibly fast data transfer speeds, as the CPU can communicate with the internal store over dedicated data and address buses. This allows the CPU to retrieve instructions and data from the internal store in a matter of nanoseconds, significantly reducing processing delays.</p></li>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong><br />
<p>The direct connection between the CPU and the internal store eliminates the need for additional data transfers and protocol conversions, which can introduce latency and overhead. This streamlined communication improves the overall efficiency of the computer system, allowing the CPU to focus on executing instructions and processing data rather than managing data movement.</p></li>
<li><strong>Simplified System Design:</strong><br />
<p>The direct accessibility of the internal store simplifies the design of computer systems. By reducing the number of components and interfaces involved in data transfer, the system becomes more reliable and easier to maintain. This simplification also contributes to the overall cost-effectiveness of the computer system.</p></li>
<li><strong>Instruction Execution:</strong><br />
<p>Direct access to the internal store is crucial for the execution of program instructions. When a program is loaded into the internal store, the CPU fetches the instructions from memory and decodes them. The CPU then accesses the internal store to retrieve data and operands required for the execution of those instructions. This seamless interaction between the CPU and the internal store enables the rapid and efficient execution of programs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The direct accessibility of the internal store by the CPU is a fundamental aspect of computer architecture that contributes to the overall performance, efficiency, and simplicity of modern computing systems.</p>
<h3>Faster than external storage</h3>
<p>The internal store outperforms external storage devices in terms of speed due to several factors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Proximity:</strong><br />
<p>The internal store is physically located within the computer case, while external storage devices are connected via cables or interfaces. This proximity to the CPU reduces the distance that data needs to travel, resulting in significantly faster data transfer speeds.</p></li>
<li><strong>Dedicated Data Paths:</strong><br />
<p>The internal store has dedicated data paths, such as the memory bus, that are specifically designed for high-speed data transfer between the CPU and memory modules. External storage devices, on the other hand, share data transfer channels with other peripherals, which can introduce delays and contention.</p></li>
<li><strong>Optimized Hardware:</strong><br />
<p>The internal store utilizes specialized hardware components, such as high-speed memory chips and controllers, that are optimized for fast data access and retrieval. External storage devices, while still employing advanced technologies, may have performance limitations due to factors such as mechanical components or slower interfaces.</p></li>
<li><strong>Caching Mechanisms:</strong><br />
<p>The internal store often employs caching mechanisms to further improve data access speeds. Frequently accessed data is stored in a small, high-speed cache memory, which is directly accessible by the CPU. This reduces the need to retrieve data from the main memory, resulting in faster data access times.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of these factors makes the internal store significantly faster than external storage devices, allowing the CPU to access data and instructions at blazing speeds, enabling responsive and efficient program execution.</p>
<h3>Limited capacity compared to external storage</h3>
<p>While the internal store offers superior speed, it is limited in terms of storage capacity compared to external storage devices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Size Constraints:</strong><br />
