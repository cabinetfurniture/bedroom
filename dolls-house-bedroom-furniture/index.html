<h3>Decide on the size</h3>
<p>Once you have chosen a style, you need to decide on the size of the dolls house bedroom furniture. Dolls house furniture comes in a variety of sizes, so it is important to measure the dimensions of your dollhouse bedroom before you start shopping. You don't want to buy furniture that is too big or too small for your space.</p>
<p>The most common scale for dolls house furniture is 1:12, which means that 1 inch of furniture is equal to 1 foot in real life. However, there are also other scales available, such as 1:6, 1:18, and 1:24. If you are not sure what scale your dollhouse is, you can measure the height of a dollhouse door.

<h3>Consider the scale</h3>

However, there are also other scales available, such as 1:6, 1:18, and 1:24.</p>
<p>It is important to choose furniture that is the correct scale for your dolls house. If you choose furniture that is too large or too small, it will look out of place. For example, if you have a 1:12 scale dolls house, you should choose furniture that is also 1:12 scale. If you choose furniture that is 1:6 scale, it will be too large for your dolls house.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what scale your dolls house is, you can measure the height of a dollhouse door. A standard door in a 1:12 scale dollhouse is about 3 inches tall. Once you know the scale of your dolls house, you can start shopping for furniture.</p>
