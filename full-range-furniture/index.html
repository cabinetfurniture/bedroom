<p><strong>Tip 3: Create a Cohesive Look:</strong><br />
To create a cohesive look for your garden furniture, consider choosing pieces from the same collection or with similar design elements. You can also incorporate outdoor rugs, cushions, and throw pillows to add pops of color and texture.çµ±ä¸çé¡è²æé¢¨æ ¼ä¹æå©æ¼çé åè«§çå¤è§ã</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Protect Your Furniture from the Elements:</strong><br />
