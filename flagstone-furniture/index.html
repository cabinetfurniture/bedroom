<p>The most common color of flagstone is gray, but it can also be found in hues of brown, red, yellow, and even green. The color of the stone is determined by the presence of different minerals, such as iron, manganese, and copper.</p>
<p>In addition to color, flagstone also varies in texture. Some pieces have a smooth and even surface, while others are more粗糙and textured. The texture of the stone is determined by the way it was formed and the type of rock from which it was quarried.</p>
