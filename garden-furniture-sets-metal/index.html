<p>Cleaning metal garden furniture is a breeze. Simply wipe down the surfaces with a damp cloth and mild detergent to remove dirt, dust, and debris. For tougher stains or grime, you can use a specialized metal cleaner or a mixture of baking soda and water. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and dry with a soft cloth to prevent water spots.</p>
<p>To maintain the longevity and beauty of your metal furniture set, it's advisable to cover it during extended periods of inclement weather or when not in use. Regular cleaning and occasional application of a protective sealant can further enhance its resistance to rust and corrosion.</p>
<p>With minimal maintenance and easy cleaning, metal garden furniture sets offer a hassle-free way to enjoy your outdoor space without spending hours on upkeep and maintenance.</p>
