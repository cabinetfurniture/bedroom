<p><strong><em>Question 2: What are the most popular materials for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 2: Popular materials for garden furniture include wood (teak, acacia, eucalyptus), metal (aluminum, wrought iron), plastic (polyethylene, polypropylene), and wicker (natural or synthetic). Each material offers unique advantages in terms of durability, weather resistance, and aesthetics.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 3: How can I make my garden furniture more comfortable?</em></strong><br />
Answer 3: To enhance the comfort of your garden furniture, consider adding cushions, pillows, and throws. Choose weather-resistant fabrics that can withstand outdoor conditions. You can also add an outdoor rug to define the space and provide a soft surface underfoot.</p>
