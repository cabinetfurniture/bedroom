<h3>Impeccable joinery</h3>
<p>Impeccable joinery is a hallmark of Lucinda Furniture Maker's craftsmanship. It refers to the precise and seamless manner in which the different parts of a furniture piece are joined together. This requires a high level of skill and experience, as even the slightest misalignment can compromise the structural integrity and aesthetics of the piece.</p>
<p>Lucinda's artisans use a variety of traditional and modern joinery techniques to ensure that their furniture is both beautiful and durable. These techniques include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mortise and tenon joinery:</strong> This is a traditional technique that involves creating a mortise (a hole) in one piece of wood and a tenon (a protruding tongue) on another piece. The tenon is then inserted into the mortise and secured with glue or pegs.</li>
  <li><strong>Dovetail joinery:</strong> This is a more complex technique that involves cutting interlocking dovetail-shaped joints in two pieces of wood. When the joints are fitted together, they create a very strong and durable connection.</li>

</ul>

<p>Lucinda's artisans use a variety of traditional and modern finishing techniques to achieve their signature look. These techniques include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hand-rubbed oil finishes:</strong> These finishes are applied by hand and rubbed into the wood using a cloth or brush. They penetrate deeply into the wood, enhancing the grain and providing a natural, matte finish.</li>
  <li><strong>Wax finishes:</strong> Wax finishes are applied in a similar manner to oil finishes, but they create a harder, more durable finish. Wax finishes are also water-resistant, making them ideal for furniture that is likely to be exposed to moisture.</li>
  <li><strong>Lacquer finishes:</strong> Lacquer finishes are applied in multiple layers, creating a hard, glossy finish that is resistant to scratches and stains. Lacquer finishes are often used on furniture that is intended for heavy use.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these traditional finishes, Lucinda's artisans also use modern finishing techniques, such as UV curing and catalyzed finishes.
