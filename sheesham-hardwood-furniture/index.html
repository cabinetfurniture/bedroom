<h3>Rich, golden-brown hue</h3>
<p>Sheesham hardwood is renowned for its striking golden-brown hue, which adds warmth and elegance to any living space. This natural color variation is due to the presence of tannins and other organic compounds in the wood.</p>
<p>Unlike many other types of wood that darken over time, sheesham wood tends to retain its rich golden-brown color with minimal fading, even with prolonged exposure to sunlight. This makes it an excellent choice for furniture pieces that will be placed in areas with abundant natural light.</p>
<p>The golden-brown hue of sheesham hardwood complements a wide range of interior design styles, from traditional to contemporary. Its warm and inviting tone creates a cozy and inviting atmosphere in any room.</p>

<h3>Distinctive grain patterns</h3>
<p>Sheesham wood is known for its distinctive grain patterns, which add visual interest and character to furniture pieces. These patterns are a result of the tree's natural growth process and vary from plank to plank, making each piece of furniture unique.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Straight grains:</strong> Sheesham wood often exhibits straight grains, which run parallel to the length of the plank. These grains create a clean and classic look, adding a subtle touch of elegance to furniture pieces.</li>
<li><strong>Wavy grains:</strong> Wavy grains, as the name suggests, form gentle curves and waves within the wood. These patterns add a sense of movement and dynamism to furniture, creating a visually appealing and unique aesthetic.</li>
<li><strong>Interlocked grains:</strong> Interlocked grains occur when the wood fibers change direction abruptly, creating a distinctive and visually striking pattern. Furniture pieces with interlocked grains are particularly durable and resistant to warping.</li>
<li><strong>Burr patterns:</strong> Burr patterns are formed when the tree develops a burl, which is a growth with a distinctive and highly figured grain pattern. Furniture pieces made from burr wood are highly sought-after due to their unique and decorative appearance.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Regular dusting:<br /></strong>Regular dusting with a soft, dry cloth is sufficient to remove dust and dirt from the surface of sheesham furniture. Avoid using abrasive cloths or cleaners, as these can damage the finish.</li>

<li><strong>Protect from spills:<br /></strong>While sheesham wood is resistant to stains, it is always advisable to clean up spills immediately to prevent any damage. Use a clean cloth to blot up the spill and avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid direct sunlight:<br /></strong>Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause the wood to fade over time. Place your sheesham furniture in areas with indirect light to preserve its color and finish.</li>
