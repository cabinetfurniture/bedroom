<h3>Paragraph after details</h3>

<p>Corndell has been struggling for some time. The company has been hit by the perfect storm of rising costs, changing consumer habits, and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rising costs:</strong> The cost of goods and materials has been rising steadily in recent years. This has made it difficult for Corndell to maintain its profit margins.</li>
<li><strong>Changing consumer habits:</strong> Consumers are increasingly shopping online and at discount stores. This has led to a decline in footfall in Corndell's stores.</li>
<li><strong>COVID-19 pandemic:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the retail sector. Corndell's stores were forced to close during lockdowns, and footfall has been slow to recover since they reopened.</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors have all contributed to Corndell's financial difficulties. The company has been loss-making for several years, and its debts have been mounting.</p>
<p>Corndell has tried to address its challenges. The company has cut costs, closed stores, and invested in its online presence. However, these measures have not been enough to turn the company's fortunes around.</p>
<p>As a result, Corndell has been forced to enter administration. The company is now in the hands of administrators, who will try to sell the business or its assets.</p>
<h3>Paragraph after list</h3>
<p>Corndell's struggle is a sign of the challenges facing the UK retail sector. The sector is undergoing a period of rapid change, and many traditional retailers are struggling to adapt. It is possible that Corndell will not be the last UK retailer to enter administration in the coming months.</p><h3>Financial difficulties exacerbated by COVID-19 pandemic</h3>

<p>Corndell Furniture's stores were forced to close during lockdowns, and footfall has been slow to recover since they reopened. The company has also been hit by supply chain disruptions, which have led to delays in getting products to customers.</p>
<p>The pandemic has also led to a change in consumer spending habits. Consumers are increasingly shopping online and at discount stores, which has further reduced footfall in Corndell Furniture's stores.</p>
<p>As a result of these factors, Corndell Furniture has seen a significant decline in sales and profits. The company has also been forced to increase its borrowing to cover its losses.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major challenge for Corndell Furniture. The company has been forced to adapt to changing consumer habits and supply chain disruptions, and it has also had to deal with a significant decline in sales and profits.</p>
<h3>Paragraph after details</h3>
<p>Corndell Furniture is not the only retailer to have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many other retailers have also seen a decline in sales and profits, and some have even been forced to close down.</p>
<p>The pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online shopping, and many consumers are now more likely to buy furniture and other homeware products online than they were before the pandemic.</p>

Wood is a classic choice, but it requires regular maintenance to protect it from rot and decay. Metal is durable and weather-resistant, but it can be hot to the touch in the sun.

If you have a small garden, you may want to choose a set of smaller furniture, such as a bistro set or a couple of chairs and a table.</p>
<p><strong>3. Think about how you will use the furniture.</strong> Before you buy garden furniture, think about how you will use it. If you like to entertain guests, you may want to choose a set of chairs and a table. If you prefer to relax in your garden, you may want to choose a lounger or a swing.</p>
<p><strong>4. Clean and care for your furniture regularly.</strong> To keep your garden furniture looking its best, it is important to clean and care for it regularly. You should clean your furniture with a mild soap and water solution, and you should protect it from the elements by covering it when it is not in use.
