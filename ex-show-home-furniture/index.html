<h3>Look for damage and test for sturdiness.</h3>
<p>When you are inspecting ex-show home furniture for damage, be sure to look for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scratches and dents.</strong> These are the most common types of damage to ex-show home furniture. They can be caused by people bumping into the furniture or by moving it around. Scratches and dents are usually not serious, but they can detract from the appearance of the furniture.</li>

<li><strong>Tears.</strong> Tears can be caused by sharp objects or by people pulling on the fabric. Tears can be repaired, but they can be expensive to fix.</li>
<li><strong>Loose joints.</strong> Loose joints can cause the furniture to wobble or collapse. Be sure to check all of the joints of the furniture to make sure they are tight and secure.</li>

<p>To test the sturdiness of a piece of furniture, you can try the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gently shake the furniture.</strong> If the furniture wobbles, it is not sturdy.
</li><li><strong>Sit on the furniture.</strong> If the furniture sinks or creaks, it is not sturdy.</li>
<li><strong>Open and close the drawers and doors.</strong> If the drawers and doors do not open and close smoothly, the furniture is not sturdy.</li>

<li><strong>Be prepared to walk away.</strong><br /><p>If the seller is not willing to negotiate, be prepared to walk away from the deal. There are plenty of other pieces of ex-show home furniture available, so you don't have to settle for a price that you are not comfortable with.</p></li>
<li><strong>Be willing to compromise.</strong><br /><p>Negotiation is all about compromise. Be willing to meet the seller halfway, but don't be afraid to stand your ground if you think the seller is asking for too much money.</p></li>

Consider factors such as durability, weather resistance, and maintenance requirements when choosing a material.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tip 2: Measure your space.</em></strong></p>
<p>Before you start shopping for garden furniture, measure the space where you plan to put it. This will help you choose furniture that is the right size for your garden. You don't want to overcrowd your garden with too much furniture, but you also want to make sure you have enough furniture to accommodate your needs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tip 3: Consider your needs.</em></strong></p>
<p>Think about how you will be using your garden furniture. If you will be entertaining guests, you might choose a dining set. If you will be relaxing in your garden, you might choose a lounge set. If you have children, you might choose furniture that is durable and easy to clean.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tip 4: Protect your furniture.</em></strong></p>
<p>To extend the life of your garden furniture, protect it from the elements. Cover your furniture when it is not in use and store it in a dry place during the winter months. You can also apply a sealant to your furniture to protect it from the sun and rain.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you can choose and care for garden furniture that will last for years to come.</p>
