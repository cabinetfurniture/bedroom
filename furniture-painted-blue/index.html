<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> How much maintenance are you willing to do? Some materials, such as wood, require regular maintenance to keep them looking their best. Other materials, such as plastic, are virtually maintenance-free.</li>
<li><strong>Style:</strong> What style of furniture do you want? Some materials, such as metal, have a more modern look. Other materials, such as wicker, have a more traditional look.</li>
<li><strong>Budget:</strong> How much money are you willing to spend on garden furniture? Some materials, such as rattan, are more expensive than others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Choose the right size.</strong></p>
<p>When choosing garden furniture, it is important to choose the right size. The furniture should be large enough to accommodate your needs, but it should not be so large that it overwhelms the space.</p>
