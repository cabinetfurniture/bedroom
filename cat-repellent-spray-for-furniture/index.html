<p><strong>Long-lasting solutions:</strong><br />
Long-lasting cat repellent sprays provide a more permanent solution to cat scratching and chewing.

<p><strong>Choosing the right formula:</strong><br />
When choosing a cat repellent spray, consider the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The severity of the problem:</strong> If your cat is only occasionally scratching or chewing your furniture, a temporary solution may be sufficient. However, if your cat is causing significant damage, you may need a long-lasting solution.<br /></li>
<li><strong>The area you need to protect:</strong> If you only need to protect a small area, a temporary solution may be sufficient. However, if you need to protect a large area, you may need a long-lasting solution.<br /></li>
<li><strong>Your budget:</strong> Temporary cat repellent sprays are typically less expensive than long-lasting sprays. However, you may need to reapply temporary sprays more often, which can end up costing more in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<p>By considering these factors, you can choose the right cat repellent spray for your needs and budget.</p>
