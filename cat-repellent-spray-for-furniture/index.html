When choosing a cat repellent spray, consider the following factors:</p>

<li><strong>The area you need to protect:</strong> If you only need to protect a small area, a temporary solution may be sufficient. However, if you need to protect a large area, you may need a long-lasting solution.<br /></li>
<li><strong>Your budget:</strong> Temporary cat repellent sprays are typically less expensive than long-lasting sprays. However, you may need to reapply temporary sprays more often, which can end up costing more in the long run.</li>
</ul>
