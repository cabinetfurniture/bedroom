Fabric furniture is comfortable and stylish, but it may require more maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Measure your space:</strong> Before you purchase garden furniture, be sure to measure the space where you plan to put it. This will help you avoid buying furniture that is too large or too small for your space.

<p><strong>Tip 4: Care for your garden furniture:</strong> To keep your garden furniture looking its best and lasting for years to come, it's important to care for it properly. Clean the furniture regularly with a mild detergent and water. If the furniture is made of wood, apply a sealant or protector to help protect it from the elements.
