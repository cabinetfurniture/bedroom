   </li>
   <li><strong>Non-Toxic Finishes:</strong><br />
      <p>Choose furniture sets with non-toxic finishes that are safe for your baby. Look for finishes that are certified by reputable organizations, such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) or the Greenguard Environmental Institute.</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>
   Ready to elevate your outdoor space with stylish and functional garden furniture? Here are four practical tips to help you make the most of your garden furniture selection:
</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Measure Your Space:</strong><br />
   Before you start shopping for garden furniture, take accurate measurements of your outdoor space. This will help you determine the size and layout of furniture that will fit comfortably without overcrowding the area.</p>

<p><strong>Tip 3: Choose Durable and Weather-Resistant Materials:</strong><br />
   Garden furniture is exposed to the elements, so it's important to select pieces made from durable and weather-resistant materials. Teak, acacia, and metal are excellent choices for outdoor furniture due to their natural resistance to rot and decay. If you choose cushions or fabrics, ensure they are water-resistant or can be easily cleaned.</p>
