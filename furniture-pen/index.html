<li><strong>Satin:</strong><br /><p>Satin finishes are somewhere between matte and glossy, providing a soft, subtle sheen.</p></li>
<li><strong>Metallic:</strong><br /><p>Metallic finishes give your furniture a shiny, metallic look, perfect for adding a touch of glamour or sophistication.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The type of finish you choose will depend on your personal preferences and the style of your furniture. If you're not sure which finish to choose, you can always test different finishes on an inconspicuous area of your furniture to see which one you like best.</p>
