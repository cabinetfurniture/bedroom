<h3>Support furniture pieces</h3>
<p>Furniture brackets play a vital role in supporting furniture pieces and preventing them from collapsing under stress. They do this by distributing the weight of the furniture and its contents evenly across the entire structure.</p>
<p>For example, in a cabinet, furniture brackets are used to connect the shelves to the sides and back of the cabinet. This helps to distribute the weight of the items stored on the shelves, preventing the shelves from sagging or collapsing.</p>
