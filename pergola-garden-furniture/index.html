You can also use a furniture cleaner that is specifically designed for the type of material your furniture is made from. To protect your garden furniture from the elements, you should cover it with a furniture cover when it is not in use.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tip 4: Store your furniture properly.</em></strong><br />
