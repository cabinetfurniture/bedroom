Measure the area where you plan to place the furniture and consider the number of seats you need. Ensure that there is enough space for people to move around comfortably and safely.</p>
<p><strong>Functionality:</strong> In addition to shape and size, consider the functionality of the fire pit furniture. Some models come with built-in storage compartments, which can be useful for storing firewood, cushions, or other outdoor accessories.

<p>When choosing garden furniture with fire pits, safety should be a top priority. Look for models that incorporate safety features to minimize the risks associated with open flames and heat.</p>
<p><strong>Spark screens:</strong> Spark screens are essential safety accessories for fire pits. They help prevent flying embers and sparks from escaping the fire pit, reducing the risk of igniting nearby materials or causing wildfires. Choose fire pit furniture with built-in spark screens or purchase a separate spark screen to place over the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Heat shields:</strong> Heat shields are designed to protect the surrounding area from excessive heat generated by the fire pit. They are typically made from metal or ceramic and are placed around the base of the fire pit. Heat shields help prevent burns and damage to nearby furniture, plants, or structures.</p>
<p><strong>Stable design:</strong> The stability of your fire pit furniture is crucial for safety. Choose models with a wide and sturdy base to prevent them from tipping over, especially on uneven surfaces. Ensure that the furniture isããã£ããconstructed and can support the weight of the fire pit and its contents.</p>
<p>By prioritizing safety features when selecting your garden furniture with fire pits, you can create a safe and enjoyable outdoor space where you and your guests can gather around a warm and inviting fire without worry.</p>

<li><strong>Ergonomic design:</strong> Consider furniture with ergonomic designs that conform to the natural curves of your body. This will help reduce fatigue and discomfort, especially during long gatherings.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustable features:</strong> If possible, opt for furniture with adjustable features, such as reclining chairs or adjustable table heights. This allows you to customize your seating position for optimal comfort.</li>
